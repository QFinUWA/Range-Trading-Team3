Things to consider:
    * How much do we put into each position?
    * Trade off between speed and accuracy
    * CLOSING POSITIONS WHEN ADX>=25

Indicators:
    * Average Directional Index:

        - https://medium.com/codex/algorithmic-trading-with-average-directional-index-in-python-2b5a20ecf06a
        - The trend has strength when ADX is above 25; the trend is weak or the price is trendless when ADX is below 20, according to Wilder.
    
    * Relative Strength index:

        - Isaac stole code from Aria
        - Momentum indicator, uses speed and magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overvalued and undervalued conditions of security
        - When first implemented, used it to check that when price fell below BOLL BAND, stock wasn't overvalued (overbought)

STUCTURE

Introduction
- define strategy 
- define range trading
- all or nothing by definition
    * maybe adjust amount of $$$ invested based on vol (risk tolerance)

RSI
- explain
- hyperpareters
- implementation
    mention we initally used it as a check before buying

Bollinger bands
- hyperpareters

ADX
- define
- hyperpareters
- explain
    same interval and bollinger bands
    ADX > 25
    20 < ADX < 25
    10 < ADX < 20
    ADX < 10
- graph piecewise function in desmos

- implementation

Results:
- Overfitting
- Must be sideways market

Discussion
- Must be sideways market recap
- Bias of picking a sideways market
- Overfitting recap
- Hyperparemeters need to be finetuned
    - recap our hyperpareters
- optimal trading strategy to use outside/inside ADX bounds?
